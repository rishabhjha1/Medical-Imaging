# üß† Brain Tumor Segmentation using Deep Learning  

This project uses **Deep Learning** to automate the segmentation of brain tumors from medical imaging data (e.g., MRI scans). The primary goal is to accurately identify and segment tumor regions to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosis and treatment planning. By leveraging state-of-the-art neural network architectures, the system provides highly accurate and reliable results for medical imaging tasks.

## üìã Overview  

Brain tumors are life-threatening conditions, and their precise identification is crucial for successful diagnosis and treatment. Traditional manual segmentation by radiologists is time-consuming and prone to variability. This project aims to address these challenges by automating the process with **Deep Learning** models, which provide fast, accurate, and reproducible segmentation results.  

### Key Features:
- **Automated Tumor Segmentation**: Detects and segments brain tumors from MRI scans with high accuracy.  
- **State-of-the-Art Models**: Utilizes advanced architectures like **U-Net**, **ResNet**, or **Attention U-Net** for high-quality segmentation.  
- **3D Medical Imaging Support**: Handles multi-dimensional data for volumetric tumor segmentation.  
- **Pretrained Weights**: Models can leverage transfer learning to improve performance with limited data.  
- **Visualization Tools**: Displays segmented regions overlaid on the original MRI images for easy interpretation.  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used  

- **Python** üêç  
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**:  
  - **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch** for building and training the neural networks.  
- **Libraries**:  
  - **Numpy**, **Pandas**: Data manipulation and preprocessing.  
  - **OpenCV**, **Pillow**: Image processing.  
  - **SimpleITK**, **Nibabel**: For handling medical imaging formats (e.g., NIfTI).  
- **Visualization**:  
  - **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly** for visualizing results.  

## üìä Dataset  

The dataset typically consists of MRI scans with annotated tumor regions. Commonly used datasets include:  
- **BraTS (Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge) Dataset**: Contains annotated MRI scans with different tumor types (e.g., gliomas, edema).  

### Preprocessing:  
- MRI scans are normalized to ensure consistent intensity ranges.  
- Augmentation techniques (rotation, flipping, scaling) are applied to increase the dataset size and diversity.  
- Data is split into **training**, **validation**, and **test** sets.  


## ‚ö° Usage  

1. Preprocess your MRI scans:  
   Convert raw MRI scans into a suitable format (e.g., `.nii`, `.mha`, `.dcm`) using tools like SimpleITK or Nibabel.  

2. Train the model:  
   Run the training script to train the segmentation model.  
  

3. Evaluate the model:  
   After training, test the model on unseen data to evaluate performance.  
  

4. Perform inference:  
   Use the trained model to segment tumors in new MRI scans.  
  

## üèÜ Model Evaluation  

Evaluate the model using standard segmentation metrics, including:  
- **Dice Coefficient (F1-Score)**  
- **Intersection over Union (IoU)**  
- **Precision and Recall**  



## üß† Explainability  

To enhance trustworthiness, use visualization techniques like **Grad-CAM** or **Saliency Maps** to explain model predictions and highlight areas of importance in MRI scans.
